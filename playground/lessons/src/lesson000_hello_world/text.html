<h2>Hello, friend!</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the Gleam Playground!
</p>
<p>
  The Gleam code on the left is editable and will be compiled and
  evaluated as you type. Anything you print using <code>io.println</code>
  or <code>io.debug</code> will be shown in the lower right, along with any
  compile errors and warnings.
</p>
<p>
  To compile your code this playground has a WASM version of the Gleam
  compiler which is used to compile Gleam to JavaScript code, which is
  then evaluated in the browser.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib">Gleam standard library</a>
  is loaded into the playground, so you can import any of the modules it
  contains.
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/list.html"><code>gleam/list</code></a>
  and
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html"><code>gleam/result</code></a>
  are Gleamlin favourites.
</p>
<p>
  Happy hacking!
</p>
