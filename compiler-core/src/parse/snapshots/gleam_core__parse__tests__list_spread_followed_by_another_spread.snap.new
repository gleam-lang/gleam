  │    ^^^^ I wasn't expecting elements after this

Lists are immutable and singly-linked, so to append items to them
all the elements of a list would need to be copied into a new list.
This would be slow, so there is no built-in syntax for it.

Hint: Prepend items to the list and then reverse it once you are done.
