----- ERROR
error: Unsupported target
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:4:1
  │
4 │ pub fn no_impl() -> Int
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `no_impl` function is public but doesn't have an implementation for the
JavaScript target. All public functions of a package must be able to
compile for a module to be valid.

error: Unsupported target
   ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:10:3
   │
10 │   no_impl()
   │   ^^^^^^^

This value is not available as it is defined using externals, and there is
no implementation for the JavaScript target.

Hint: Did you mean to build for a different target?
