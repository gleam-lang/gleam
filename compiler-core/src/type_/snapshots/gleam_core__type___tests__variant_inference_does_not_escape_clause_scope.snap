   │    ^^ This field does not exist

The value being accessed has this type:

    Thingy

It does not have any fields shared by all variants.

Note: The field you are trying to access might not be consistently present
or positioned across the custom type's variants, preventing reliable
access. Ensure the field exists in the same position and has the same
type in all variants, or pattern matching on it to enable direct accessor
syntax.
