warning: Inexhaustive pattern
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:3
  │
3 │   let True = x
  │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This assignment uses a pattern that does not match all possible
values. If one of the other values is used then the assignment
will crash.

The missing patterns are:

    False

In a future version of Gleam this will become a compile error.

Hint: Use a more general pattern or use `let assert` instead.
