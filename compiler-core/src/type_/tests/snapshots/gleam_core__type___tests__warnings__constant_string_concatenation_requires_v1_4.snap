1 │ pub const string = "wibble" <> "wobble"
  │                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.4.0

Constant strings concatenation was introduced in version v1.4.0. But the
Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this code to
run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.4.0"
