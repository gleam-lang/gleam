warning: Redundant record
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:5:8
  │
5 │   case Wibble(n) {
  │        ^^^^^^^^^ You can remove this record wrapper

Instead of building a record and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -> todo
    }
