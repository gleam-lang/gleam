3 │   let assert Ok(10) = Ok(20) as "This will crash..."
  │                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.7.0

Specifying a custom panic message when using let assert was introduced in
version v1.7.0. But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml`
would allow this code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting
in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.7.0"
