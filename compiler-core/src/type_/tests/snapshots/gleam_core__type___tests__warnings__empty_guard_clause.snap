----- WARNING
warning: Deprecated empty guard clause syntax
  ┌─ test/path:5:12
  │
5 │         10 if -> True
  │            ^^ This should be followed by a guard or removed!!


Empty clause within a guard is deprecated.
To keep its behaviour, either remove the guard or fill the clause with
`True` instead.
