  │           ^^^^^^

This function call is unreachable because its last argument always panics.
Your code will crash before reaching this point.

warning: Unused pure function call
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:4:11

4 │           wibble(1, panic)
  │           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This pure function call is never used

Gleam is an immutable language, meaning functions cannot mutate state
simply by being called. This function is pure, so it must be assigned to a
variable to have an effect on the program.
