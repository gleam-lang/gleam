----- SOURCE CODE

@external(erlang, "wibble", "wobble")
pub type Wobble


----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:1
  │
3 │ pub type Wobble
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.14.0

The `@external` annotation on custom types was introduced in version
v1.14.0. But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would
allow this code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in
compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.14.0"
