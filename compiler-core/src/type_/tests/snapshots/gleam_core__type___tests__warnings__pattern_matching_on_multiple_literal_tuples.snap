warning: Redundant tuple

  │              ^^^^^^^ You can remove this tuple wrapper

Instead of building a tuple and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -> todo
    }
