warning: Redundant list

  │              ^^^^^^ You can remove this list wrapper

Instead of building a list and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -> todo
    }
