The value being accessed has this type:

    Person

It has these fields:

    .name

Note: The field you are trying to access might not be consistently present
or positioned across the custom type's variants, preventing reliable
access. Ensure the field exists in the same position and has the same type
in all variants to enable direct accessor syntax.
