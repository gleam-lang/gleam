----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:3
  │
3 │   assert x == 2
  │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.11.0

The bool `assert` statement was introduced in version v1.11.0. But the
Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this code to
run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.11.0"
