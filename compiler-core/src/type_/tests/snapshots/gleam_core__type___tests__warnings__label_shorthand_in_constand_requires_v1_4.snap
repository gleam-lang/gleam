  │                           ^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.4.0

The label shorthand syntax was introduced in version v1.4.0. But the Gleam
version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this code to run
on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.4.0"
