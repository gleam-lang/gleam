Field access on custom types when the variant is known was introduced in
version v1.6.0. But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml`
would allow this code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting
in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.6.0"
