----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:4:7
  │
4 │     <<"hello">> -> Nil
  │       ^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.5.0

The ability to omit the `utf8` annotation for string segments was
introduced in version v1.5.0. But the Gleam version range specified in your
`gleam.toml` would allow this code to run on an earlier version like
v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.5.0"
