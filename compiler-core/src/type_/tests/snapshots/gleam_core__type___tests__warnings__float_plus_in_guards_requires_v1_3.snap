----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:4:10
  │
4 │     _ if 1.0 +. 1.0 == 2.0 -> Nil
  │          ^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.3.0

Arithmetic operations in guards were introduced in version v1.3.0. But the
Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this code to
run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.3.0"
