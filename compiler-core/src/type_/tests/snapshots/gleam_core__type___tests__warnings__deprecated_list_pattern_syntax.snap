warning: Deprecated list pattern matching syntax
  ┌─ test/path:5:13
  │
5 │         ["a"..rest] -> rest
  │             ^^ This spread should be preceded by a comma

This syntax for pattern matching on a list is deprecated.
When matching on the rest of a list it should always be preceded by a
comma, like this: `[item, ..list]`.
