----- WARNING
warning: Truncated bit array segment
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:5
  │
3 │   <<65_537:size(2)-unit(8)>>
  │     ^^^^^^ You can safely replace this with 1

This segment is 2 bytes long, but 65537 doesn't fit in that many bytes. It
would be truncated by taking its first 2 bytes, resulting in the value 1.
