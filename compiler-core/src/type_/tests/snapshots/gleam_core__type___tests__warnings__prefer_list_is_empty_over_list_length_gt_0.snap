----- WARNING
warning: Inefficient use of `list.length`
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:6:21

  │                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `list.length` function has to iterate across the whole
list to calculate the length, which is wasteful if you only
need to know if the list is empty or not.

Hint: You can use `the_list != []` instead.
