error: Unknown record field
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:7:3
  │
7 │   user.login()
  │   ^^^^^^^^^^ Did you mean `id`?

The value being accessed has this type:

    User

It has these fields:

    .id
    .name

Gleam is not object oriented, so if you are trying to call a method on this
value you may want to use the function syntax instead.

    login(value)
