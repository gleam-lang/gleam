----- WARNING
warning: Truncated bit array segment
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:5
  │
3 │   <<-200:size(8)>>
  │     ^^^^ You can safely replace this with 56

This segment is 1 byte long, but -200 doesn't fit in that many bytes. It
would be truncated by taking its its first byte, resulting in the value 56.
