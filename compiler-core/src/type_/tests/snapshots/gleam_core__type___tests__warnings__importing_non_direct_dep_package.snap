warning: Transitive dependency imported

2 │ import some_module
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module `some_module` is being imported, but `non-dependency-package`,
the package it belongs to, is not a direct dependency of your package.
In a future version of Gleam this may become a compile error.

Run this command to add it to your dependencies:

    gleam add non-dependency-package
