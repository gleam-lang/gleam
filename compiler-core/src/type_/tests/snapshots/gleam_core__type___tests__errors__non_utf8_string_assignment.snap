This pattern assigns a non UTF-8 string to a variable in a bit array. This
is planned to be supported in the future, but we are unsure of the desired
behaviour. Please go to https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/4566 and
explain your usecase for this pattern, and how you would expect it to
behave.
