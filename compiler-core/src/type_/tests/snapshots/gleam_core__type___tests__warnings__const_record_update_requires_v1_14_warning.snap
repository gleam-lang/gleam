  │                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.14.0

The record update syntax for constants was introduced in version v1.14.0.
But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this
code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation
errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.14.0"
