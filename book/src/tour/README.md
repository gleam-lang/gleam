In this chapter we explore the fundamentals of the Gleam language, namely its
syntax, core data structures, flow control features, and static type system.

After completion the reader should know enough to start reading and writing
Gleam code, assuming they have some prior programming experience.

In some section we touch on the runtime representation of various features.
This is useful for programmers with Erlang or Elixir experience who wish to
use Gleam alongside these languages. If you are using Gleam alone this
information can be safely ignored.
