# Breaking changes to make for v2

- Remove `[1 ..]` syntax: due to a bug in the parser we accept that as a valid
  list. At the moment we just raise a warning saying it's deprecated and the
  formatter removes it.
- Do not allow `_ as a` anywhere in patterns. It doesn't make a lot of sense
  since one could just write `a` instead and we don't want two ways of doing the
  same thing.
- Do not allow shadowing an imported value, the same way one can't define two
  top level functions with the same name.
- Do not allow to use dev dependencies under `src/`.
