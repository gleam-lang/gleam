  It's common to want to call a series of functions, passing the result of one
  to the next. With the regular function call syntax this can be a little
  difficult to read as you have to read the code from the inside out.
</p>
<p>
  Gleam's pipe operator <code>|></code> helps with this problem by allowing you
  to write code top-to-bottom.
</p>
<p>
  The pipe operator takes the result of the expression on its left and passes it
  as an argument to the function on its right.
</p>
<p>
  It will first check to see if the left-hand value could be used as the first
  argument to the call. For example, <code>a |> b(1, 2)</code> would become
  <code>b(a, 1, 2)</code>. If not, it falls back to calling the result of the
  right-hand side as a function, e.g., <code>b(1, 2)(a)</code>
</p>
<p>
  Gleam code is typically written with the "subject" of the function as the
  first argument, to make it easier to pipe. If you wish to pipe to a different
  position then a function capture can be used to insert the argument to the
  desired position.
