<p>
  Up until now each function has accepted precisely one type for each of its
  arguments.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>twice</code> function for example only worked with functions that
  would take and return ints. This is overly restrictive, it should be possible
  to use this function with any type, so long as the function and the initial
  value are compatible.
</p>
<p>
  To enable this Gleam support <em>generics</em>, also known as <em>parametric
  polymorphism</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This works by instead of specifying a concrete type, a type variable is used
  which stands in for whatever specific type is being used when the function is
  called. These type variable are written with a lowercase name.
</p>
<p>
  Type variables are not like an <code>any</code> type, they get replaced with a
  specific type each time the function is called. Try uncommenting
  <code>twice(10, exclaim)</code> to see the compiler error from trying to use a
  type variable as an int and a string at the same time.
