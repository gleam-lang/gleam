<p>
  Lists are ordered collections of values.
</p>
<p>
  <code>List</code> is a generic type, having a type parameter
  for the type of values it contains. A list of ints has the type
  <code>List(Int)</code>, and a list of strings has the type
  <code>List(String)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Lists are immutable single-linked lists, meaning they are very efficient to
  add and remove elements from the front of the list.
</p>
<p>
  Counting the length of a list or getting elements from other positions in the
  list is expensive and rarely done. It is rare to write algorithms that index
  into sequences in Gleam, but but when they are written a list is not the right
  choice of data structure.
