  The <code>fn</code> keyword is used to define new functions.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>double</code> and <code>multiply</code> functions are defined
  without the <code>pub</code> keyword. This makes them <em>private</em>
  functions, they can only be used within this module. If another module
  attempted to use them it would result in a compiler error.

  Like with assignments, type annotations are optional for function arguments
  and return values. It is considered good practice to use type annotations for
  functions, for clarity and to encourage intentional and thoughtful design.
