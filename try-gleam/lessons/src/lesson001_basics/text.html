<p>
  Here is a program that prints out the text "Hello, Joe!".
</p>
<p>
  It does this by using the `println` function which has been imported from the
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html"><code>gleam/io</code></a>
  module, which is part of the Gleam standard library.
</p>
<p>
  In a normal Gleam program this program would be run use the command
  <code>gleam run</code> on the command line, but here in this tutorial the
  program is automatically compiled and run as the code is edited.
</p>
<p>
  Try changing the text being printed to <code>Hello, Mike!</code> and see what
  happens.
