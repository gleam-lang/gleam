  Gleam has a robust static type system that is help you as you write and edit
  code, catching mistakes and showing you where to make changes.
</p>
<p>
  Uncomment the line <code>io.println(4)</code> and see how a compile time error
  is reported as the <code>io.println</code> function only works with strings,
  not ints.
</p>
<p>
  To fix the code change the code to call the <code>io.debug</code>
  function instead, as it will print a value of any type.
</p>
<p>
  Gleam has no <code>null</code>, no implicit conversions, no exceptions, and
  always performs full type checking. If the code compiles you can be reasonably
  confident it does not have any inconsistencies that may cause bugs or
  crashes.
