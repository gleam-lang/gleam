<h2>Hello, friend ðŸ’«</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to Try Gleam! An interactive tour of the Gleam programming language.
</p>
<p>
  It covers all aspects of the Gleam language, and assuming you have some
  prior programming experience should teach you everything you need to write
  real programs in Gleam.
</p>
<p>
  The tour is interactive! The code shown is editable and will be compiled and
  evaluated as you type. Anything you print using <code>io.println</code> or
  <code>io.debug</code> will be shown in the lower right, along with any compile
  errors and warnings. To evaluate Gleam code the tour compiles Gleam to
  JavaScript and runs it, all entirely within your browser window.
</p>
<p>
  If at any point you get stuck or have a question do not hesitate to ask in
  <a href="https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy">the Gleam Discord server</a>. We're here
  to help, and if you find something confusing then it's likely others will too,
  and we want to know about it so we can improve the tour.
