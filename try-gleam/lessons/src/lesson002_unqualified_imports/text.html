<p>
  Normally functions from other modules are used in a qualified fashion, with
  the module qualifier before function name. For example,
  <code>io.println("Hello!")</code>.
</p>
<p>
  It is also possible to specify a list of functions to import from a module in
  an unqualified fashion, such as the <code>println</code> function in the code
  editor. Because it has been imported like this it can be referred to as just
  <code>println</code>.

  Generally it is best to use qualified imports, as this makes it clear where
  the function is defined, making the code easier to read.
