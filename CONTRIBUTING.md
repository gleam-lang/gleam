## Local development

To run the compiler tests.

```shell
cargo test
```

If you don't have Rust or Cargo installed you can run the above command in a docker sandbox.
Run the command below from this directory.

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd):/opt/app -it -w /opt/app rust:1.44.0 bash
```

## Rust development

Here are some tips and guidelines for writing Rust code in the Gleam compiler:

Never write code that can cause the compiler to panic (`panic!`, `unwrap`,
`expect`) as a compiler panic is confusing to the user. When possible rewrite
the code in a way that makes the error impossible. If that cannot be done and
the error is either common or due to a mistake by the user return an error
value that will be printed with an appropriate helpful error message. If the
error _should_ never happen and its occurrence indicates a fatal compiler bug
the `.gleam_expect` method of the `GleamExpect` trait can be used. This is
similar to `.expect` but prints a more helpful error message to the user.

The `GLEAM_LOG` environment variable can be used to cause the compiler to
print more information for debugging and introspection. i.e.
`GLEAM_LOG=trace`.
