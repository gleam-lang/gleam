# Project

A test Gleam project using the Deno runtime.

It covers these features:

- Deno runtime specific configuration, including
  - `location` - used to configure [`--location`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/runtime/location_api) flag which sets the [`location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) global from the web.

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run
gleam test
```
