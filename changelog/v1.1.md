## v1.1.0-rc1 - 2024-04-08

### Compiler

- The `@internal` attribute can now be used to annotate definitions.
  This will hide those definitions from the generated documentation,
  autocompletions and the exported module interface.
- Prepending to lists in JavaScript (`[x, ..xs]` syntax) has been optimised.
- Function stubs are no longer generated for functions that do not have an
  implementation for the current targeting being compiled for.
- Fixed a bug where some functions would not result in a compile error when
  compiled for a target that they do not support.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes a warning would not be emitted when a result is
  discarded.
- Fixed a bug with JavaScript code generation of pattern matching guards.
- URLs in error messages have been updated for the new language tour.
- Improved error message when erroneously trying to append items to a list using
  the spread syntax (like `[..rest, last]`).
- Generate [type references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#-reference-types-)
  when compiling to JavaScript with TypeScript definitions enabled.
- Fix a bug where JavaScript code generation would not properly return the
  result of nested blocks.
- Fix a bug where JavaScript code generation would not properly handle functions
  returned by blocks.
- Fix a bug where Erlang code generation would not properly handle list case
  patterns with no head and a spread tail.
- The compiler will now raise a warning if you're pattern matching on tuple
  literals and suggest you use multiple subjects instead.
- Fixed a bug where JavaScript code generation would incorrectly parenthesise a
  return statement.
- Nested tuple access (`tuple.0.1`) now parses successfully.
- Error messages are more clear about expecting values instead of types.
- Fixed a bug where pattern matching on a string would cause the program to
  crash on the JavaScript target.
- A warning is now emitted when defining an opaque external type.
- Improve error message when using incorrect quotes (`'`) to define a string
- Fixed a bug where Erlang string prefix patterns could generate invalid Erlang.
- Fixed string prefix matching producing wrong results on the JavaScript target
  when the prefix had a Unicode codepoint escape sequence (`\u{...}`).
- Improved error message for wrong patterns using constructors from other
  modules.
- Fixed a bug on the JavaScript target where variables bound by patterns, if
  used within a bit array literal inside a `case` clause's guard, would be used
  before they were defined, leading to a runtime error when evaluating the
  `case` expression.
- Improved error messages when failing to parse a series of things.
- A warning is now raised for unused binary operations, records, record access
  and record updates.
- Fixed a bug when using constant as the size option parameter
  for `BitArray` caused unknown variable exception.
- Improved recommendations on error messages.
- Improved error message for `BitArray` segment sizes.
- A warning is now raised when an internal type is accidentally exposed in a
  package's public API.
- Fixed the error message when using `panic` on the JavaScript target: it now
  correctly identifies the error variant as a `panic` instead of a `todo`.
- Fixed a bug on the JavaScript target where empty lists with little space
  available could compile to a conversion from the array `[ , ]`, causing them
  to wrongly have a length of one (the array has a single `undefined` element).

### Formatter

- The formatting of case expressions with multiple subjects has been improved.
- Fixed a bug where the formatter would move comments from the end of bounded
  expressions like lists, tuples, case expressions or function calls.
- Fixed a bug where a record update's arguments would not be indented correctly.
- Fixed a bug where function call arguments, tuple items and list items would be
  needlessly indented if preceded by a comment.
- Line endings other than `\n` are now handled by the formatter, preserving
  blank lines and converting them to `\n`.
- The formatter can now format groups of imports alphabetically.
- Fixed a bug where comments would be moved out of an empty list.
- Fixed a bug where pipes and binary operations in function calls would be
  nested more than necessary.
- Improved formatting of comments in binary operation chains.

### Build tool

- Added support for the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime when compiling to
  JavaScript by using `gleam run --target javascript --runtime bun`
- Allow compilation of packages that require `"rebar"` using the rebar3
  compiler.
- A warning is now emitted if there is a `.gleam` file with a path that would be
  invalid as a module name.
- The `~> x.y` version constraint syntax has been dropped in favour of
  `> x.y.z and <= xx.0.0` syntax in `gleam add` and `gleam new`, for clarity.
- New projects are created with the GitHub `actions/checkout` v4 action.
- Fixed a bug where bit arrays would break syntax highlighting in the generated
  HTML documentation.
- Dependencies that use Erlang-only bit options can now compile on JavaScript,
  though the functions that use them will not be available for use in the root
  package.
- The output format of the command line help messages have been changed
  slightly.
- The command line help text now lists valid targets and runtimes.
- Generated documentation no longer exposes the constructors of opaque types,
  no longer exposes the values of constants, and indicates which types are
  opaque.
- Generated HTML documentation now includes a link to the package on Hex.
- Terminal colors can now be forced by setting the `FORCE_COLOR` environment
  variable to any non-empty value.
- Rust's Reqwest's `webpki-roots` are now used for TLS verification.
- Update Deno config to allow passing `--location` runtime flag.
- Fixed a bug with dependency resolution of exact versions of RC releases.
- Fixed a bug where the documentation of a labelled record constructor could be
  assigned to the wrong definition in the doc site.
- Fixed a bug where the code blocks in the generated documentation's site would
  have a wrong indentation.
- Fixed a bug where the compiler would panic when it cannot get current
  directory.
- Improved error message for non-UTF-8 paths encountered during Gleam commands.
  Now includes the path that caused the error for better diagnostics.
- Fixed a bug where on windows local packages had absolute paths in the manifest
  instead of relative.
- The `gleam publish` command now asks for confirmation if the package
  repository URL doesn't return a successful status code.
- `gleam publish` can now optionally use a Hex API key to authorise publishing
  and retiring packages, set via the environment variable `HEXPM_API_KEY`.
- `gleam publish` will now refuse to publish placeholder packages, to prevent
  name squatting which is against the Hex terms of service.
- If a package leaks an internal type in its public API, then the build tool
  will now refuse to publish it to Hex.
- Monospaced links in the generated documentation now have the same color as
  common links.
- Fixed a bug where the `export package interface` command would always
  recompile the project ignoring the cache.

### Language Server

- Update messages from the client are now batched to avoid doing excess
  compilation work in the language server, improving performance. This makes a
  large difference in low power machines where the language server could
  struggle to keep up with the edits from the client.
- The `Compiling Gleam` message is no longer emitted each time code is compiled.
  This is to reduce noise in editors that show this message prominently such as
  Neovim.
- Fixed a bug where hovering over an expression in the middle of a pipe would
  give the wrong node.
- Go to definition now works for values in dependency Gleam modules.
- Completions are now provided for module imports.

  documentation.

## v1.0.0-rc2 - 2024-02-14

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the exhaustiveness checker could crash for some generic
  types.

### Formatter

- The format used by the formatter has been improved in some niche cases.
- Improved the formatting of long case guards.

## v1.0.0-rc1 - 2024-02-10

### Language changes

- Using a reserved word is now a compile error, not a warning.
- Inexhaustive matches are now compile errors, not warnings.
- The warning for an unused module alias now shows how to not assign a name to
  the module.
- Type aliases with unused type parameters now emit an error.
- Type definitions with duplicate type parameters now emit an error.

### Formatter

- Now the formatter will nest pipelines and binary operators that are used as
  function arguments, list items or as tuple items.
- The format function literals used as the last argument in a function call
  on long lines has been improved.

### Build tool

- If a package contains a `todo` expression then the build tool will now refuse
  to publish it to Hex.
- `gleam export` now takes a `package-interface` option to export a json file
  containing metadata about the root package.
- `gleam docs build` now creates a json file containing metadata about the root
  package.
- The order of dependencies in `manifest.toml` is now in alphabetical order.
- The search bar in generated docs now has a darker background color.
- The generated docs no longer shows whether an argument is discarded or
  not in a function signature.
- It is now possible to use `gleam run -m` to run a dependency module even if
  that dependency uses a compile target that your project does not support.

  values inserted into the parent type using type parameters.
- Fixed a bug where `functionname(_name)` would incorrectly parse as a function
  capture instead of a syntax error.
- Fixed a bug where external only functions would "successfully" compile for a
  target they do not support, leading to a runtime error.

## v0.34.1 - 2023-01-17

### Build tool changes

- Support has been added for using SourceHut as a repository.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where long function headers with external implementations could

## v0.34.0 - 2023-01-16

## v0.34.0-rc3 - 2023-01-12

### Language changes

- "echo" is now a reserved word.
- A warning is no longer emitted when a function has a Gleam implementation as
  well as external implementations for both targets. This is because having a
  default Gleam implementation means the code is future-proof and continues to
  be cross platform even if a new target is added.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where function heads would go over the line limit in the
  formatter.

## v0.34.0-rc2 - 2023-01-11

- Warn about function body not being used, because it already has external
  implementations for all targets.
- It's now possible to compile a project with external functions in dependency
  packages that are not supported by the compilation target so long as they are
  not used on the current target.
- The error message for when one imports a constructor instead of an homonymous
  type has been improved.

### Language Server Changes

- Added a `View on HexDocs` link on function hover.

### Formatter

- Fixed some quirk with the formatting of binary operators.
- Fixed a bug where the formatter would move a function call's closed
  parentheses on a new line instead of splitting the function's arguments.
- Now the formatter will format tuples as if they were functions, trying to
  first split just the last element before splitting the whole tuple.
- Improved the formatting of multiline strings in string concatenation.

### Build tool changes

- The `gleam new` command now accepts any existing path, as long as there are
  no conflicts with already existing files. Examples: `gleam new .`, `gleam new
..`, `gleam new ~/projects/test`.
- The format for the README created by `gleam new` has been altered.
- The `gleam.toml` created by `gleam new` now has a link to the full reference
  for its available options.
- The `gleam` binary is now statically linked on Windows.
- New projects are created requiring between versions of v0.34.0 inclusive and
  exclusive v2.0.0.
- The `repository` section now supports additional VCS types in the form of
  codeberg, forgejo and gitea allowing a `user`, `repo` and additionally a
  `host` url.
- TypeScript declaration for the prelude exports previously missing functions
  and classes. Additionally, swaps interfaces for classes and adds missing
  attributes to classes.

- Fixed a bug where the build tool would make unnecessary calls to the Hex API
  when path dependencies are used.
- Fixed a bug where `gleam new` would generate a gitignore with `build` rather
  than `/build`.
- Fixed where the types of generic constants could be incorrectly inferred.
- `Utf8Codepoint` has been renamed to `UtfCodepoint` in `prelude.d.mts`.
- Fixed a bug where `gleam deps list` would look in filesystem root instead of
  the current directory.
- Fixed a bug with the `isEqual` function in `prelude.js` where RegExps were
  being incorrectly structurally compared and being falsely reported as being
  equal.
- JavaScript: export from `prelude.d.mts` in `gleam.d.mts` to fix the error:
  "Type 'Result' is not generic".
- Not providing a definition after some attributes is now a parse error.

## v0.33.0 - 2023-12-18

- The deprecated `inspect` functions and `BitString` type has been removed from
  the JavaScript prelude.

## v0.33.0-rc3 - 2023-12-17

### Formatter

- The formatter now tries to split long chains of binary operations around the
  operator itself, rather than around other elements like lists or function
  calls.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where string prefix aliases defined in alternative case branches
  would all be bound to the same constant.

## v0.33.0-rc2 - 2023-12-07

### Language changes

- The `\e` string escape sequence has been removed. Use `\u{001b}` instead.
- Generated Erlang now disabled redundant case clause warnings as these are now
  redundant due to exhaustiveness checking.

  on Erlang on the right hand side of a string concatenation.

## v0.33.0-rc1 - 2023-12-06

### Formatter

- The formatter now tries to keep a function body and its arguments on a single
  line by first trying to split only its last argument on multiple lines.
- Fixed a bug where the formatter would move comments out of blocks.
- `gleam format` now ignores the Gleam build directory by default, even when not
  in a git repository.

### Language changes

- Gleam now has full exhaustiveness checking. Exhaustiveness issues have been
  downgraded from errors to warnings so that existing Gleam code can be
  upgraded to be exhaustive without breaking existing code. In a future version
  they will be upgraded to errors.
- The `!` operator can now be used in clause guards.
- The words `auto`, `delegate`, `derive`, `else`, `implement`, `macro`, and
  `test` are now reserved for future use. If used they will emit a warning. In
  a future version this may be upgraded to an error.
- The `\u{...}` syntax can be used in strings to specify unicode codepoints via a
  hexadecimal number with 1 to 6 digits.
- The `todo as` and `panic as` syntaxes now accept an expression that evaluates
  to a string rather than just a string literal.

### Build tool changes

- The `gleam run` and `gleam test` commands gain the `-t` flag, which is an
  alias of the `--target` flag.
- The `gleam build`, `gleam check`, `gleam run` and `gleam test` commands now
  also accept `js` and `erl` as values for the `--target` flag.
- The `gleam new` command now creates packages at version 1.0.0.
- The `gleam publish` command now asks for confirmation if the package being
  published is not yet version 1.0.0.

  one that implies the package is maintained by the Gleam core team.
- The error messages shown when dependency resolution fails have been improved.

### Compiler WASM API

- The WASM API for the compiler has been rewritten to be simpler.
- The WASM API for the compiler now exposes warnings.

  when pretty printing a zero arity function call when the line is over 80
  columns wide.
- Fixed a bug where the build directory could be left in an invalid state if
  there is Elixir code to compile and running on Windows without permission to
  create symlinks.
- Fixed a bug where numbers with preceding zeros could generate incorrect
  JavaScript.
- The Erlang code generated by the `/.` operator no longer generates a warning
  for the upcoming negative zero float change in Erlang OTP 27.
- Fixed a bug where using only types from an aliased import, wouldn't stop the
  compiler from emitting an unused alias warning for that import.
- Fixed a bug where the formatter would remove the ` as name` from string prefix
  patterns.
- Fixed a bug where the formatter would misplace comments at the start of a
  block.
- Fixed a bug where using a string prefix pattern in `let assert` would generate
  incorrect JavaScript.

### Build tool changes

- The build tool now supports rebar3 and mix hex packages where the package name
  differs from the otp application name.

### bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where invalid javascript code could be generated when a module
  function calls another function that was passed as an argument and the
  argument has the same name as the module function.

### Language changes

- Imported modules can now be discarded by giving them an alias starting with `_`.

### Build tool changes

- New projects are now generated with the call to `gleam format` coming last in
  the GitHub Actions workflow. This is so that feedback from tests is presented
  even if formatting is incorrect.
- Added Windows support for the `gleam export erlang-shipment` command.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where some nested pipelines could fail to type check.

## v0.32.2 - 2023-11-03

### Build tool changes

  shadowed a prelude name with an import of the same name but a different kind.
- Fixed a bug where documentation would not publish to Hexdocs for packages with
  a number in the name.
- Fixed a bug where aliased unqualified types and values of the same name could
  produce an incorrect error.

## v0.32.1 - 2023-11-02

## v0.32.0-rc1 - 2023-10-25

### Language changes

- Using `import module.{TypeName}` to import a type has been deprecated,
  replaced by `import module.{type TypeName}`. In a future version of Gleam the
  old syntax will only import the value of the same name. Run `gleam fix` to
  update your code.
- The `BitString` type has been renamed to `BitArray`. Run `gleam fix` to update
  your code.

  build components when checking for compatibility.
- The prelude is no longer rendered once per package when compiling to
  JavaScript, instead one copy is rendered for the entire project. If you are
  using the `gleam compile-package` API you now need to give a path to the
  prelude using the `--javascript-prelude` flag.
- The `gleam export javascript-prelude` and `gleam export typescript-prelude`
  commands have been added to export a copy of the prelude. This command may be
  useful for build tools that use the compiler via the `gleam compile-package`
  API.
- Fixed a bug where some deprecation messages would not be printed.
- The content has been made wider in rendered HTML documentation.
- Dependencies that can be built with both `mix` and `rebar3` are now built
  with `mix` if it exists on the system, and with `rebar3` if it doesn't.

  or the type of the hovered argument.
- Use `import type` for importing types from typescript declarations.
- Use `.d.mts` extension for typescript declarations to match `.mjs`.
- Prefix module names with dollar sign in typescript to avoid name collisions.

## v0.30.4 - 2023-07-26

- External implementations are always referenced directly in generated code, to
  avoid the overhead of an extra function call.
- Fixed a bug where the compiler could infer incorrect generic type parameters
  when analysing a module without type annotations with self recursive

- Added a new `..` syntax for discarding the remaining fields of a record.
- Using the same variable name multiple times in the same pattern will now
  raise an error.
- Discard can now be omitted in list tails in patterns, ie `[x, ..]` is the
  same as `[x, .._]`. The former is the preferred version and is emitted by the
  formatter.

  custom type definition statement. Instances of these custom types are called
  records.
- Anonymous structs have been renamed tuples.
- Values and types can be given a new name when imported in the unqualified
  fashion using the `import mod.{value as name}` syntax.
- An error will be emitted if multiple values constructors are defined with
  the same name in a module.

## v0.5.1 - 2019-12-23

- Fixed a bug where invalid Erlang would be generated when using a local
  private function as a value.

## v0.5.0 - 2019-12-16

[Release Blog Post](https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.5-released/)

- Enum constructor arguments can now be labelled, allowing arguments to be
  given by name at the call site.
- An Erlang header file with a record definition is generated for each Gleam
  struct defined.
- `gleam new` creates a project at v1.0.0.
- Function calls are now properly escaped when the function name conflicts
  with an Erlang keyword.
- References to unqualified imported functions now generate correct Erlang
  code.

  case expressions.
- Fixed a bug where variable rebinding of function arguments would generate
  incorrect code.

## v0.5.0-rc1 - 2019-11-26

- Function arguments can be labelled, allowing arguments to be given by name
  at the call site.
- `case` expressions now accept multiple subjects, enabling pattern matching
  on multiple values simultaneously.
- Values and types can be imported from modules and references in an
  unqualified fashion.
- Named structs now have their name as the first element in the generated
  Erlang code. This enabled easier use from Erlang by defining records for
  them, as well as slightly clearer printf debugging.
- Anonymous structs have been introduced, serving as a quick and generic
  alternative to declared structs and as a format for interop with Erlang
  tuples.
- `gleam new` now accepts a `--template` flag to generate different styles of
  project. An OTP application template has been added alongside the existing
  OTP library template.
- `gleam new` now creates configuration for GitHub Actions, making Gleam
  projects ready for continuous integration out of the box.
- The syntax for defining enums, case expressions, and blocks has been changed
  to a syntax closer to that found in the C family of languages.
- The source code preview for functions that return a type incompatible with
  the functions annotations has been improved to be more precise.
- A helpful error message is rendered if an enum field contains a generic type
  that has not been declared.
- A bug has been fixed in which type mismatch errors originating from pattern
  matching would sometimes display the incorrect expected type.

## v0.4.2 - 2019-10-22

- Fixed a crash when an incorrect number of labelled struct arguments are
  given.
- Fixed a struct labelled argument being incorrect reported as already given.

## v0.4.1 - 2019-09-29

  number of type parameters.

## v0.4.0 - 2019-09-19

- The struct data type has be introduced. Structs are pre-declared user
  defined data types with named fields and constant access time.
- The map and tuple data types has been removed, replaced by the struct data
  type.
- The generated code no longer contains export statements if no functions are
  exported from a module.
- Comparison operators have been specialised to operate only on Ints.
- The `>.` `>=.` `<.` and `<=.` comparison operators have been added for
  comparing Floats.
- It is now an error to export an enum which has a constructor that takes a
  private type as an argument.
- The error messages for defining multiple modules with the same name and for
  importing test modules into application code have been improved.
- Numbers are now permitted in type names and constructors.
- The `Nil` constructor will no longer erroneously be of type `Int`.

## v0.3.0 - 2019-08-08

[Release Blog Post](https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.3-released/)

- New project structure can be generated with the `gleam new` command.
- Functions can be annotated with their argument and return types. This may be
  used to restrict the function to a less general type than inferred by the
  compiler, or purely for documentation purposes.
- External function names and their target functions are now escaped in the
  generated code if they collide with Erlang keywords such as `catch` or `or`.
- Type error arising from the arguments of function calls have more accurate
  error diagnostics.
- Precompiled Gleam binaries are now available on the GitHub release page.
- Precompiled Docker images containing the Gleam binary are now available on
  DockerHub.
- The formatting of the Erlang code rendered by the compiler has been altered
  to improve legibility.

  syntax is used with too many underscores.
- A helpful error message is now rendered when attempting to import an unknown
  module.

## v0.2.0 - 2019-06-25

- Modules can now live within namespaces such as `my_app/user/profile`.
- The name of the variable created can be specified when importing a module
  using the `import my_mod as name` syntax.
- Function names and atoms are now escaped in the generated code if they
  collide with Erlang keywords such as `catch` or `or`.
- There is a shorthand syntax for prepending multiple elements to a list.
  `[1, 2, 3 | my_list]`

## v0.1.2 - 2019-05-12

- Types containing more than 26 type variables will no longer render with
  invalid type variable names.
- Types in error messages no longer have extra indentation that increases as
  the type gets larger.
- There is a new type `Nil` which is occupied by a single value (`Nil`). This
  type is used to represent the absence of a value and is commonly used with
  `Result` to model a value that is either present (`Ok(value)`) or absent
  (`Error(Nil)`).
- Zero arity enum constructors now generate the correct Erlang when used in
  modules other than the one they are defined in.

## v0.1.1 - 2019-04-28

- Error messages now display the path of the file containing the problem.
- Maps and modules with erroneous extra fields now have a custom error
  message.
- Rows with tails that are unbound type variables are now correctly unified in
  the type system. This fixes a bug in which maps and modules may sometimes
  fail to type check when there is no error.
