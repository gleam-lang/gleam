# We want fancy syntax highlighting on GitHub, though GitHub doesn't know how
# to speak Gleam. Until it does (maybe one day!) we'll tell GitHub that these
# files are Rust, which has a similar enough syntax for the highlighting to
# work in most cases.
# The only caveat is that we need to add a `;` after each use of the `type`
# keyword as our type syntax is different to theirs in a way that confuses
# GitHub.
