/// ## Examples
///
/// *Currying* creates a new function that is identical to the given function
/// except that arguments must now be supplied one by one over several function
/// calls. It thus is the process of taking a function with `n` arguments
/// and producing a sequence of `n` single-argument functions. Given:
///
/// ```gleam
/// > fn my_fun(i: Int, s: String) -> String { ... }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦calling `curry2(my_fun)` would return the curried equivalent, like so:
///
/// ```gleam
/// > curry2(my_fun)
/// fn(Int) -> fn(String) -> String
/// ```
///
/// Currying is useful when you want to partially apply a function with
/// some arguments and then pass it somewhere else, for example:
///
/// ```gleam
/// > import gleam/list
/// > let multiply = curry2(fn(x, y) { x * y })
/// > let doubles = list.map([1, 2, 3], multiply(2))
/// [2, 4, 6]
