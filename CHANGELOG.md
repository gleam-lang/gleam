# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Compiler

- The compiler can now tell if some branches with bit array patterns are
  unreachable. For example, the following code:

  ```gleam
  case payload {
    <<first_byte, _:bits>> -> first_byte
    <<1, _:bits>> -> 1
    _ -> 0
  }
  ```

  Will raise the following warning:

  ```
  warning: Unreachable case clause
    ┌─ /src/bit_array.gleam:4:5
    │
  4 │     <<1, _:bits>> -> 1
    │     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  This case clause cannot be reached as a previous clause matches the same
  values.
  Hint: It can be safely removed.
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The code generated for pattern matching on the JavaScript target has been
  improved to be more efficient and perform as little checks as possible.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler now raises a warning when it can tell that an integer segment
  with a literal value is going to be truncated. For example, if you wrote this:

  ```gleam
  <<258>>
  ```

  The compiler will now warn you:

  ```txt
  warning: Truncated bit array segment
    ┌─ /src/main.gleam:4:5
    │
  4 │   <<258>>
    │     ^^^ You can safely replace this with 2

  This segment is 1 byte long, but 258 doesn't fit in that many bytes. It
  would be truncated by taking its its first byte, resulting in the value 2.
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler will now include labels in the error message when a `case`
  expression is inexhaustive. For example, this code:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, age: Int)
  }

  pub fn classify(person: Person) {
    case person {
      Person(name: "John", age: 27) -> todo
      Person(name: _, age: 42) -> todo
    }
  }
  ```

  Will produces this error:

  ```
  error: Inexhaustive patterns
    ┌─ /src/main.gleam:6:3
    │
  6 │ ╭   case person {
  7 │ │     Person(name: "John", age: 27) -> todo
  8 │ │     Person(name: _, age: 42) -> todo
  9 │ │   }
    │ ╰───^

  This case expression does not have a pattern for all possible values. If it
  is run on one of the values without a pattern then it will crash.

  The missing patterns are:

      Person(name:, age:)
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The analysis of lists, tuples, negation operators, `panic`, `echo` and `todo`
  is now fault tolerant, meaning that the compiler will not stop reporting
  errors as soon as it finds one.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The error message for types used with the wrong number of arguments has been
  improved. For example, this piece of code:

  ```gleam
  type Wibble(a)

  type Wobble {
    Wobble(Wibble)
  }
  ```

  Produces the following error:

  ```txt
    error: Incorrect arity
    ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:5:10
    │
  5 │   Wobble(Wibble)
    │          ^^^^^^ Expected 1 type argument, got 0

  `Wibble` requires 1 type argument but none where provided.
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- You can now use the `assert` keyword by itself to test a boolean expression.
  If the expression evaluates to `False` at runtime, the `assert` statement
  will cause the program to panic, with information about the expression that
  was asserted.

  For example:

  ```gleam
  pub fn ok_error_test() {
    assert result.is_ok(Ok(10))
    assert result.is_error(Error("Some error"))
    assert Ok(1) != Error(1)
    assert result.is_error(Ok(42)) // panic: Assertion failed
  }
  ```

  A custom panic message can also be provided in order to add extra information:

  ```gleam
  pub fn identity_test() {
    assert function.identity(True) as "Identity of True should never be False"
  }
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The compiler will now emit a warning when the return value of a call to a
  function without side effects is unused. For example the following code:

  ```gleam
  fn add(a, b) { a + b }
  ```

  Will produce the following warning:

  ```
  warning: Unused value
    ┌─ /src/main.gleam:4:3
    │
  4 │   add(1, 2)
    │   ^^^^^^^^^ This value is never used

  This expression computes a value without any side effects, but then the
  value isn't used at all. You might way to assign it to a variable, or
  delete the expression entirely if it's not needed.
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The compiler will now generate more efficient code for `let assert` on the
  Erlang target.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The compiler will now reject bit array segment patterns whose constant size is
  zero or negative. Previously a zero or negative sized segment would crash the
  compiler.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler will not generate needless code for unused pattern variables.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

### Build tool

- The build tool now supports placing modules in a directory called `dev`,
  which like `test`, is only for development code.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- There is now a new CLI command, `gleam dev`, which runs the `$PACKAGE_dev`
  module, for running development entrypoints.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Updated the Erlang shipment POSIX entrypoint script to add an exec statement
  so the Erlang process replaces the shell's process and can receive signals
  when deployed.
  ([Christopher De Vries](https://github.com/devries))

- The build tool now provides additional information when printing warnings for
  deprecated environment variables.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

### Language server

- The code action to add missing labels to function now also works in patterns:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, age: Int, job: String)
  }

  pub fn age(person: Person) {
    let Person(age:) = person
    age
  }
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, age: Int, job: String)
  }

  pub fn age(person: Person) {
    let Person(age:, name:, job:) = person
    age
  }
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The JSON encoding function that the language server code action generates is
  now named `$TYPENAME_to_json` instead of `encode_$TYPENAME`. This is to remove
  ambiguity with functions that encode to other formats, and to make the
  function easier to discover by searching.

  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- The code action to add missing patterns to a `case` expression now includes
  labels in the generated patterns. For example:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, age: Int)
  }

  pub fn classify(person: Person) {
    case person {
      Person(name: "John", age: 27) -> todo
      Person(name: _, age: 42) -> todo
    }
  }
  ```

  Will now become:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, age: Int)
  }

  pub fn classify(person: Person) {
    case person {
      Person(name: "John", age: 27) -> todo
      Person(name: _, age: 42) -> todo
      Person(name:, age:) -> todo
    }
  }
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The language server now provides hover, autocomplete and goto definition
  for constant definitions.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The "generate function" code action can now choose better names based on the
  labels and variables used. For example if I write the following code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn main() -> List(Int) {
    let list = [1, 2, 3]
    let number = 1
    remove(each: number, in: list)
  //^^^^ This function doesn't exist yet!
  }
  ```

  And ask the language server to generate the missing function, the generated
  code will now look like this:

  ```gleam
  fn remove(each number: Int, in list: List(Int)) -> List(Int) {
    todo
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The language server now provides autocomplete suggestions for labels after
  part of the label has already been typed. For example, in this code:

  ```gleam
  pub type Person {
    Person(name: String, number: Int)
  }

  pub fn main() {
    Person(n|)
  }
  ```

  The language server will provide `name:` and `number:` as autocomplete
  suggestions.

  code, most noticeable in code inside `case` clauses and `use` expressions.
  ([Matias Carlander](https://github.com/matiascr))

  segment would generate invalid code on the Erlang target.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where the language server would generate invalid code for the
  "convert to use" code action, when used on a function call with labelled
  arguments.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where a reference to an imported external function with a
  non-alphanumeric module name would compile to invalid syntax on the Erlang
  target.
  ([Mathieu Darse](https://github.com/mdarse))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would not correctly check the size of bit
  arrays when doing bit array pattern matching on the JavaScript target.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))
