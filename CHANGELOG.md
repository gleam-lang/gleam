## v0.8.0-rc1 - 2020-04-28

- Strings are now encoded as utf8 binaries in the generated Erlang.

- Gleam code can be formatted using the `gleam format` command.
- The pipe operator `|>` will now attempt to insert the left hand side as the
  first argument to the right hand side if the right hand side is a call,
  removing the need for function capture boilerplate.
- A `record.label` syntax can now be used to access the fields of a custom
  type that have a single record variant.

  deprecated but will continue to work for now. The formatter will rewrite the
  old syntax to the new.

  same as `[x, .._]`. The former is the prefered version and is emitted by the
  formatter.

## v0.5.0 - 2019-12-16

#### [Release Blog Post](https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.5-released/)

- Enum constructor arguments can now be labelled, allowing arguments to be
  given by name at the call site.
- An Erlang header file with a record definition is generated for each Gleam
  struct defined.
- `gleam new` creates a project at v1.0.0.

  on multiple values simultaneously.
- Values and types can be imported from modules and references in an
  unqualified fashion.

- Anonymous structs have been introduced, serving as a quick and generic
  alternative to declared structs and as a format for interop with Erlang
  tuples.
- `gleam new` now accepts a `--template` flag to generate different styles of
  project. An OTP application template has been added alongside the existing
  OTP library template.

- The syntax for defining enums, case expressions, and blocks has been changed
  to a syntax closer to that found in the C family of languages.
- The source code preview for functions that return a type incompatible with
  the functions annotations has been improved to be more precise.

  that has not been declared.

  matching would sometimes display the incorrect expected type.

  given.
- Fixed a struct labelled argument being incorrect reported as already given.

  defined data types with named fields and constant access time.
- The map and tuple data types has been removed, replaced by the struct data
  type.
- The generated code no longer contains export statements if no functions are
  exported from a module.
- Comparison operators have been specialised to operate only on Ints.

#### [Release Blog Post](https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.3-released/)

- New project structure can be generated with the `gleam new` command.
- Functions can be annotated with their argument and return types. This may be
  used to restrict the function to a less general type than inferred by the
  compiler, or purely for documentation purposes.
- External function names and their target functions are now escaped in the
  generated code if they collide with Erlang keywords such as `catch` or `or`.
- Type error arising from the arguments of function calls have more accurate
  error diagnostics.
- Precompiled Gleam binaries are now available on the GitHub release page.
- Precompiled Docker images containing the Gleam binary are now available on
  DockerHub.
- The formatting of the Erlang code rendered by the compiler has been altered
  to improve legibility.

  module.

## v0.2.0 - 2019-06-25

- Modules can now live within namespaces such as `my_app/user/profile`.
- The name of the variable created can be specified when importing a module
  using the `import my_mod as name` syntax.
- Function names and atoms are now escaped in the generated code if they
  collide with Erlang keywords such as `catch` or `or`.
- There is a shorthand syntax for prepending multiple elements to a list.
  `[1, 2, 3 | my_list]`

## v0.1.2 - 2019-05-12

- Types containing more than 26 type variables will no longer render with
  invalid type variable names.
- Types in error messages no longer have extra indentation that increases as
  the type gets larger.
- There is a new type `Nil` which is occupied by a single value (`Nil`). This
  type is used to represent the absence of a value and is commonly used with
  `Result` to model a value that is either present (`Ok(value)`) or absent
  (`Error(Nil)`).
- Zero arity enum constructors now generate the correct Erlang when used in
  modules other than the one they are defined in.

## v0.1.1 - 2019-04-28

- Error messages now display the path of the file containing the problem.
- Maps and modules with erroneous extra fields now have a custom error
  message.
- Rows with tails that are unbound type variables are now correctly unified in
