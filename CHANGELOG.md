# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Build tool

- The `--template` flag for `gleam new` takes the values `erlang` and
  `javascript` to specify what target to use, with `erlang` being the default.
  ([Mohammed Khouni](https://github.com/Tar-Tarus))

- The Erlang/Elixir compiler process is now re-used for all packages, shaving
  off 0.3-0.5s per compiled package.
  ([yoshi](https://github.com/joshi-monster))

- When a symlink cannot be made on Windows due to lack of permissions the error
  now includes information on how to enable Windows' developer mode, enabling
  symlinks.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- The cli can now update individual dependencies.

  `gleam update` and `gleam deps update` now take an optional list of package names to update:

  ```shell
  gleam update package_a
  gleam deps update package_b package_c
  ```

  This allows for selective updating of dependencies.
  When package names are provided, only those packages and their unique dependencies are unlocked and updated.
  If no package names are specified, the command behaves as before, updating all dependencies.

### Compiler

- The compiler now prints correctly qualified or aliased type names when
  printing type errors.

  This code:

  ```gleam
  pub type Int

  pub fn different_int_types(value: Int) {
    value
  }

  pub fn main() {
    different_int_types(20)
  }
  ```

  Produces this error:

  ```
  error: Type mismatch
    ┌─ /src/wibble.gleam:8:23
    │
  8 │   different_int_types(20)
    │                       ^^

  Expected type:

      Int

  Found type:

      gleam.Int
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The compiler can now suggest to pattern match on a `Result(a, b)` if it's
  being used where a value of type `a` is expected. For example, this code:

  ```gleam
  import gleam/list
  import gleam/int

  pub fn main() {
    let not_a_number = list.first([1, 2, 3])
    int.add(1, not_a_number)
  }
  ```

  Results in the following error:

  ```txt
  error: Type mismatch
    ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:6:9
    │
  6 │   int.add(1, not_a_number)
    │              ^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Expected type:

      Int

  Found type:

      Result(Int, a)

  Hint: If you want to get a `Int` out of a `Result(Int, a)` you can pattern
  match on it:

      case result {
        Ok(value) -> todo
        Error(error) -> todo
      }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Improved the error message for unknown record fields, displaying an additional
  note on how to have a field accessor only if it makes sense.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler now ignores `optional` dependencies when resolving versions
  unless explicitly specified.
  ([Gustavo Inacio](https://github.com/gusinacio))

- Improved the error message for using `@deprecated` with no deprecation message
  ([Jiangda Wang](https://github.com/frank-iii))

- Optimised creation of bit arrays on the JavaScript target.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

### Formatter

- The formatter no longer removes the first argument from a function
  which is part of a pipeline if the first argument is a capture
  and it has a label. This snippet of code is left as is by the formatter:

  ```gleam
  pub fn divide(dividend a: Int, divisor b: Int) -> Int {
    a / b
  }

  pub fn main() {
    10 |> divide(dividend: _, divisor: 2)
  }
  ```

  Whereas previously, the label of the capture variable would be lost:

  ```gleam
  pub fn divide(dividend a: Int, divisor b: Int) -> Int {
    a / b
  }

  pub fn main() {
    10 |> divide(divisor: 2)
  }
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

### Language Server

- The Language Server now displays correctly qualified or aliased type names
  when hovering over a value in a Gleam file:

  ```gleam
  import gleam/option

  const value = option.Some(1)
  //    ^ hovering here shows `option.Option(Int)`
  ```

  ```gleam
  import gleam/option.{type Option as Maybe}

  const value = option.Some(1)
  //    ^ hovering here shows `Maybe(Int)`
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The Language Server now suggests a code action to add type annotations to
  local variables, constants and functions:

  ```gleam
  pub fn add_int_to_float(a, b) {
    a +. int.to_float(b)
  }
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```gleam
  pub fn add_int_to_float(a: Float, b: Int) -> Float {
    a +. int.to_float(b)
  }
  ```

  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The Language Server now suggests a code action to convert qualified imports to
  unqualified imports, which updates all occurrences of the qualified name
  throughout the module:

  ```gleam
  import option

  pub fn main() {
    option.Some(1)
  }
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```gleam
  import option.{Some}

  pub fn main() {
    Some(1)
  }
  ```

  ([Jiangda Wang](https://github.com/Frank-III))

- The Language Server now suggests a code action to convert unqualified imports to
  qualified imports, which updates all occurrences of the unqualified name
  throughout the module:

  ```gleam
  import list.{map}

  pub fn main() {
    map([1, 2, 3], fn(x) { x * 2 })
  }
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```gleam
  import list.{}

  pub fn main() {
    list.map([1, 2, 3], fn(x) { x * 2 })
  }
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the compiler where shadowing a sized value in a bit pattern
  would cause invalid erlang code to be generated.
  ([Antonio Iaccarino](https://github.com/eingin))

- Fixed a bug where the formatter would not format strings with big grapheme
  clusters properly.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed the `BitArray` constructor not being present in the types for the
  JavaScript prelude.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

- Fixed a bug where generated TypeScript definitions were invalid for opaque
  types that use a private type.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

- Fixed the prelude re-export in generated TypeScript definitions.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would incorrectly type-check and compile
  calls to functions with labelled arguments in certain cases.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where importing type aliases that reference unimported modules
  would generate invalid TypeScript definitions.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

- When splitting a constant list made of records, the formatter will keep each
  item on its own line to make things easier to read.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would crash when pattern matching on a type
  which was defined with duplicate fields in one of its variants.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where the WASM compiler would return incomplete JavaScript when
  unsupported features were used. It now returns a compilation error.
  ([Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney))

- Fixed a bug where incorrect code would be generated for external function on
  the Erlang target if any of their arguments were discarded.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug in the error message when using wrong values in a pipe where the
  message would swap the "Expected" and "Found" types.
  ([Markus Pettersson](https://github.com/MarkusPettersson98/))

- Fixed a bug where the parser would incorrectly parse a record constructor with
  no arguments.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- Fixed a bug where the language server wouldn't show hints when hovering over
  the tail of a list.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where attempting to jump to the definition of a type from the
  annotation of a parameter of an anonymous function would do nothing.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

## v1.5.1 - 2024-09-26

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where Erlang file paths would not be escaped on Windows.
