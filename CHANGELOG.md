# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Compiler

- Improved code generation for blocks in tail position on the Javascript target.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Function documentation comments and module documentation comments are now
  included in the generated Erlang code and can be browsed from the Erlang
  shell starting from OTP27.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

### Build tool

### Language server

- The language server can now fill in the labels of any function call, even when
  only some of the arguments are provided. For example:

  ```gleam
  import gleam/string

  pub fn main() {
    string.replace("wibble")
  }
  ```

  Will be completed to:

  ```gleam
  import gleam/string

  pub fn main() {
    string.replace("wibble", each: todo, with: todo)
  }
  ```

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the "convert from use" code action would generate invalid
  code for use expressions ending with a trailing comma.

- Fixed a bug where build tool could fail to add new dependencies when
  dependencies with optional dependencies are present in the manifest.

- Fixed a bug where a block expression containing a singular record update would
  produce invalid erlang.
