# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Compiler

- The compiler now performs function inlining optimisations for a specific set
  of standard library functions, which can allow functions which were previously
  not tail-recursive on the JavaScript target to become tail-recursive. For
  example, the following code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn count(from: Int, to: Int) -> Int {
    use <- bool.guard(when: from >= to, return: from)
    io.println(int.to_string())
    count(from + 1, to)
  }
  ```

  Would previously cause a stack overflow on the JavaScript target for large
  values. Now it is rewritten to:

  ```gleam
  pub fn count(from: Int, to: Int) -> Int {
    case from >= to {
      True -> from
      False -> {
        io.println(int.to_string())
        count(from + 1, to)
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Which allows tail-call optimisation to occur.

- The compiler now emits a better error message for private types marked as
  opaque. For example, the following piece of code:

  ```gleam
  opaque type Wibble {
    Wobble
  }
  ```

  Would result in the following error:

  ```
  error: Private opaque type
    ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:2:1
    │
  2 │ opaque type Wibble {
    │ ^^^^^^ You can safely remove this.

  Only a public type can be opaque.
  ```

- The parsing of opaque private types is now fault tolerant: having a private
  opaque type in a module no longer stops the compiler from highlighting other
  errors.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler now emits a single warning for multiple negations in a row, while
  previously it would emit multiple comments highlighting increasingly longer
  spans.

### Build tool

- New projects are generated using OTP28 on GitHub Actions.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- `gleam add` now adds `dependencies` and `dev-dependencies` as tables instead
  of inline tables if they are missing.
  ([Andrey Kozhev](https://github.com/ankddev))

### Language server

- The language server now offers a quick fix to remove `opaque` from a private
  type:

  ```gleam
  opaque type Wibble {
  // ^^^ This is an error!
    Wobble
  }
  ```

  If you hover over the type and trigger the quick fix, the language server will
  automatically remove the `opaque` keyword:

  ```gleam
  type Wibble {
    Wobble
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The "inline variable" code action is now only suggested when hovering over the
  relevant variable.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

### Formatter

- The formatter now removes needless multiple negations that are safe to remove.
  For example, this snippet of code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn useless_negations() {
    let lucky_number = --11
    let lucy_is_a_star = !!!False
  }
  ```

  Is rewritten as:

  ```gleam
  pub fn useless_negations() {
    let lucky_number = 11
    let lucy_is_a_star = !False
  }
  ```

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where `echo` could crash on JavaScript if the module contains
  record variants with the same name as some built-in JavaScript objects.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would highlight an entire double negation
  expression as safe to remove, instead of just highlighting the double
  negation.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would crash if there was an invalid version
  requirement in a project's `gleam.toml`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would suggest a discouraged project name as an
  alternative to the reserved `gleam` name.
