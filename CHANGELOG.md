# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Build tool

- A helpful error message is now shown if the `manifest.toml` file has been
  edited to be invalid in some way. ([zahash](https://github.com/zahash))

  ```
  error: Corrupt manifest.toml

  The `manifest.toml` file is corrupt.

  Hint: Please fun `gleam update` to fix it.
  ```

- The error message shown when unable to find package versions that satisfy all
  the version constraints specified for a project's dependencies has been
  greatly improved. ([zahash](https://github.com/zahash))

  ```
  error: Dependency resolution failed

  An error occurred while determining what dependency packages and
  versions should be downloaded.
  The error from the version resolver library was:

  Unable to find compatible versions for the version constraints in your
  gleam.toml. The conflicting packages are:

  - hellogleam
  - lustre_dev_tools
  - glint
  ```

### Compiler

- The compiler will now raise a warning for `let assert` assignments where the
  assertion is redundant.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

  ```
  warning: Redundant assertion
    ┌─ /home/lucy/src/app/src/app.gleam:4:7
    │
  4 │   let assert x = get_name()
    │       ^^^^^^ You can remove this

  This assertion is redundant since the pattern covers all possibilities.
  ```

- Empty case expressions are no longer parse errors and will instead be
  exhaustiveness errors. ([Race Williams](https://github.com/raquentin))

### Formatter

- Redundant alias names for imported modules are now removed.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

  ```gleam
  import gleam/result as result
  ```

  is formatted to

  ```gleam
  import gleam/result
  ```

- Comments are no longer moved out of constant lists, constant tuples and empty
  tuples. You can now write this:

  ```gleam
  const values = [
    // This is a comment!
    1, 2, 3
    // Another comment...
    11,
    // And a final one.
  ]
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

### Language Server

- The code action to remove unused imports now removes the entire line is
  removed if it would otherwise be left blank.
  ([Milco Kats](https://github.com/katsmil))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed [RUSTSEC-2021-0145](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0145) by
  using Rust's `std::io::IsTerminal` instead of the `atty` library.
  ([Pi-Cla](https://github.com/Pi-Cla))

- Fixed the generated `mod` property in the Erlang application file when using the
  `application_start_module` property in `gleam.toml`.
  ([Alex Manning](https://github.com/rawhat))

- Fixed some reserved keywords would resulting in confusing error messages.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed variables in constant expressions not being escaped correctly when
  exporting to JavaScript. ([PgBiel](https://github.com/PgBiel))
