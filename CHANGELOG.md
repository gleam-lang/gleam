# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Compiler

- Generated JavaScript functions, constants, and custom type constructors now
  include any doc comment as a JSDoc comment, making it easier to use the
  generated code and browse its documentation from JavaScript.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The code generated for a `case` expression on the JavaScript target is now
  reduced in size in many cases.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- The code generators now perform usage-based dead code elimination. Unused
  definitions are not longer generated.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- `echo` now has better support for character lists, JavaScript errors, and
  JavaScript circular references.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- The look of errors and warnings has been improved. Additional labels providing
  context for the error message are no longer highlighted with the same style as
  the source of the problem.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Gleam will now emit a helpful message when attempting to import modules using
  `.` instead of `/`.

  ```txt
  error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:1:11
    │
  1 │ import one.two.three
    │           ^ I was expecting either `/` or `.{` here.

  Perhaps you meant one of:

      import one/two
      import one.{item}
  ```

  ([Zij-IT](https://github.com/zij-it))

- The compiler now emits a warning when a top-level constant or function
  declaration shadows an imported name in the current module.
  ([Aayush Tripathi](https://github.com/aayush-tripathi))

- The compiler can now tell when an unknown variable might be referring to an
  ignored variable and provide an helpful error message highlighting it. For
  example, this piece of code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn go() {
    let _x = 1
    x + 1
  }
  ```

  Now results in the following error:

  ```
  error: Unknown variable
    ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:4:3
    │
  3 │   let _x = 1
    │       -- This value is discarded
  4 │   x + 1
    │   ^ So it is not in scope here.

  Hint: Change `_x` to `x` or reference another variable
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The compiler now raises a warning when performing a redundant comparison that
  it can tell is always going to succeed or fail. For example, this piece of
  code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn find_line(lines) {
    list.find(lines, fn(x) { x == x })
  }
  ```

  Would result in the following warning:

  ```
  warning: Redundant comparison
    ┌─ /src/warning.gleam:2:17
    │
  1 │   list.find(lines, fn(x) { x == x })
    │                            ^^^^^^ This is always `True`

  This comparison is redundant since it always succeeds.
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- When using two spreads, trying to concatenate lists, the compiler will now
  show a nicer error message. For example, this snippet of code:

  ```gleam
  pub fn main() -> Nil {
    let xs = [1, 2, 3]
    let ys = [5, 6, 7]
    [1, ..xs, ..ys]
  }
  ```

  Would result in the following error:

  ```
  error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:5:13
    │
  5 │   [1, ..xs, ..ys]
    │       --    ^^ I wasn't expecting a second spread here
    │       │
    │       You're using a spread here

  Lists are immutable and singly-linked, so to join two or more lists
  all the elements of the lists would need to be copied into a new list.
  This would be slow, so there is no built-in syntax for it.
  ```

  ([Carl Bordum Hansen](https://github.com/carlbordum)) and
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The error message one gets when calling a function with the wrong number of
  arguments has been improved and now only suggests the relevant missing labels.
  For example, this piece of code:

  ```gleam
  pub type Pokemon {
    Pokemon(id: Int, name: String, moves: List(String))
  }

  pub fn best_pokemon() {
    Pokemon(198, name: "murkrow")
  }
  ```

  Would result in the following error, suggesting the missing labels:

  ```txt
  error: Incorrect arity
    ┌─ /src/main.gleam:6:3
    │
  6 │   Pokemon(198, name: "murkrow")
    │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Expected 3 arguments, got 2

  This call accepts these additional labelled arguments:

    - moves
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Code generators now reuse existing variables when possible for the record
  update syntax, reducing the size of the generated code and number of
  variables defined for both Erlang and JavaScript.

  ```gleam
  pub fn main() -> Nil {
    let trainer = Trainer(name: "Ash", badges: 0)
    battle(Wobble(..trainer, badges: 1))
  }
  ```

  Previously this Gleam code would generate this Erlang code:

  ```erlang
  -spec main() -> nil.
  main() ->
      Trainer = {trainer, 0, <<"Ash"/utf8>>},
      battle(
          begin
              _record = Trainer,
              {trainer, 1, erlang:element(3, _record)}
          end
      ).
  ```


  Now this code will be generated instead:

  ```erlang
  -spec main() -> nil.
  main() ->
      Trainer = {trainer, 0, <<"Ash"/utf8>>},
      battle({trainer, 1, erlang:element(3, Trainer)}).
  ```

  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

### Build tool

- `gleam update`, `gleam deps update`, and `gleam deps download` will now print
  a message when there are new major versions of packages available.

  ```text
   $ gleam update
    Resolving versions

  The following dependencies have new major versions available:

  gleam_http 1.7.0 -> 4.0.0
  gleam_json 1.0.1 -> 3.0.1
  lustre     3.1.4 -> 5.1.1
  ```

  ([Amjad Mohamed](https://github.com/andho))

- Docs generator now strips trailing slashes from Gitea/Forgejo hosts so
  sidebar "Repository" and "View Source" links never include `//`, and
  single-line "View Source" anchors emit `#Lx` instead of `#Lx-x`.
  ([Aayush Tripathi](https://github.com/aayush-tripathi))

### Language server

- It is now possible to use the "Pattern match on variable" code action on
  variables on the left hand side of a `use`. For example:

  ```gleam
  pub type User {
    User(id: Int, name: String)
  }

  pub fn main() {
    use user <- result.try(load_user())
    //  ^^^^ Triggering the code action here
    todo
  }
  ```

  Would result in the following code:

  ```gleam
  pub type User {
    User(id: Int, name: String)
  }

  pub fn main() {
    use user <- result.try(load_user())
    let User(id:, name:) = user
    todo
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The "generate function" code action is now a quickfix, allowing it to be more
  easily applied to code which is producing an error.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

### Formatter

- The formatter now allows more control over how lists are split. By adding a
  trailing comma at the end of a list that can fit on a single line, the list
  will be split on multiple lines:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    ["natu", "chimecho", "milotic",]
  }
  ```

  Will be formatted as:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    [
      "natu",
      "chimecho",
      "milotic",
    ]
  }
  ```

  By removing the trailing comma, the formatter will try and fit the list on a
  single line again:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    [
      "natu",
      "chimecho",
      "milotic"
    ]
  }
  ```

  Will be formatted back to a single line:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    ["natu", "chimecho", "milotic"]
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The formatter now allows more control over how lists are formatted.
  If a list is split with multiple elements on the same line, removing the
  trailing comma will make sure the formatter keeps each item on its own line:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    [
      "This list was formatted", "keeping multiple elements on the same line",
      "notice how the formatting changes by removing the trailing comma ->"
    ]
  }
  ```

  Is formatted as:

  ```gleam
  pub fn my_favourite_pokemon() -> List(String) {
    [
      "This list was formatted",
      "keeping multiple elements on the same line",
      "notice how the formatting changes by removing the trailing comma ->",
    ]
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The formatter no longer removes empty lines between list items. In case an
  empty line is added between list items they will all be split on multiple
  lines. For example:

  ```gleam
  pub fn main() {
    [
      "natu", "xatu",

      "chimeco"
    ]
  }
  ```

  Is formatted as:

  ```gleam
  pub fn main() {
    [
      "natu",
      "xatu",

      "chimeco",
    ]
  }
  ```

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the language server would not show type-related code action
  for record fields in custom type definitions.
  ([cysabi](https://github.com/cysabi))

- Fixed a bug where the "Inline variable" code action would be offered for
  function parameters and other invalid cases.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where the "Inline variable" code action would not be applied
  correctly to variables using label shorthand syntax.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would emit the same error twice for patterns
  with the wrong number of labels.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where the language server would generate invalid code when the
  "Extract variable" code action was used on a `use` expression.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would crash when using the `utf8_codepoint`
  bit array segment on the JavaScript target.
  ([Surya Rose](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks))

- Fixed a bug where `==` and `!=` would return incorrect output for some
  JavaScript objects.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

## v1.11.1 - 2025-06-05

### Compiler

- The displaying of internal types in HTML documentation has been improved.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

- A warning is now emitted when the same module is imported
  multiple times into the same module with different aliases.
  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where a bit array segment matching on a floating point number
  would match with `NaN` or `Infinity` on the JavaScript target.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))
