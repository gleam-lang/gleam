### Formatter

## v1.15.1 - 2026-03-17

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where `BitArray$BitArray$data` constructed a `DataView` with
  offset 0 instead of the slice's actual byte offset, causing sliced bit arrays
  to read from the wrong position in the underlying buffer on JavaScript.
  ([John Downey](https://github.com/jtdowney))

- Fixed a bug where the "Add missing type parameter" code action could be
  triggered on types that do not exist instead of type variables.
